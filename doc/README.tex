\section{Compilation Instructions}
To compile and run the program, you will need the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item a compiler capable of handling Fortran90.
The code has been tested with the gfortran compiler. 
\item BLAS and LAPACK libraries installed in a place where the compiler knows to look for them
\item Python (version 2.5 or higher) to run various auxiliary scripts
  (e.g., for visualization). The scripts have been tested with Python
  2.6.4 only. You will also need the NumPy extension package.
\item Recommended: PyMOL to visualize pdb files.
\end{itemize}

The code has been tested on Ubuntu Linux only.

To compile with gfortran, go into the \path=source= directory. Type \verb=make=.
To compile with any other compiler that can handle Fortran90, type
\begin{verbatim}
make FC=compiler
\end{verbatim}
substituting in the command you usually use to call the compiler. 

If the compilation works properly, the executable \path=shearableWLC.exe= will appear in the main directory.

%% To test that the code is running properly, go into the \path=testing= directory and type 
%% \begin{verbatim}
%% ./runalltests.py
%% \end{verbatim}
%% This will run a number of test calculations to make sure everything works properly. The tests will take a few minutes to complete.

\section{Usage Instructions}
To run the program in the main directory, type:
\begin{verbatim}
./shearableWLC.exe suffix
\end{verbatim}

Here, \verb=suffix= can be any string up to 100 characters in length. 
The program reads in all input information from a file named
\path=param.suffix= where, again, \verb=suffix= is the command-line
argument. If no argument is supplied, it will look for a file named
\path=param=. If the desired parameter file does not exist, the
program will exit with an error.

The parameters in the input file are given in the format "{\em KEYWORD} value" where the possible keywords and values are described
in Section \ref{sec:keywords}. Each keyword goes on a separate
line. Any line that starts with "\#" is treated as a comment and
ignored. Any blank line is also ignored. The keywords in the parameter
file are not case sensitive. For the most part, the order in which the
keywords are given does not matter. All parameters have default
values, so you need only specify keywords and values when you want to
change something from the default.

%Instructions for running specific calculations are given in more
detail in Section \ref{sec:tasks}. 
Example parameter files for the
different calculations are provided in the \path=examples= directory.

\section{Examples for a Quick Start}
Example parameter files are located in the \path=examples= directory

\subsection{Example 1: equilibrium sampling}
Sample a number of chain configurations from the equilibrium distribution. Run this example by typing
\begin{verbatim}
../shearableWLC.exe ex.equildistrib
\end{verbatim}
This example uses a chain where the 2 edge segments on either side have a segment length of $0.1$ and corresponding parameters, whereas all other segments have a segment length of $0.2$.
This will sample 10000 chains in total, and output end-to-end vectors in the first three columns of the output file ex.equildistrib.out. The next 3 columns give the first orientation vector.  Snapshots of every $1000^\text{th}$ chain will be output in the \path=ex.equildistrib.snap.out= file, which can then be converted to pdb format as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
../snapshot2pdb.py ex.equildistrib.snap.out
\end{verbatim}
The resulting pdb file (\path=ex.equildistrib.snap.pdb=) can be loaded into PyMOL and colored using the following commands within PyMOL itself.
\begin{verbatim}
load ex.equildistrib.snap.pdb, multiplex=0
../scripts/viewsnapshots.pml
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Example 2: Brownian Dynamics}
Run a Brownian Dynamics simulation for 2000 chains in parallel, keeping track of shear stress correlations in the file \path=ex.browndyn.stress.out=.
The simulation starts from an equilibrium distribution and runs for 10000 steps. 

NOTE: the parameter files \path=param.regenL10N400.0 and \path=param.regenL10N10.0= can be used to reproduce the dynamic results shown in Fig.4 of Koslover and SPakowitz, 2014 for $\Delta=0.025$ and $\Delta=1$, respectively. Note that for generating the results of the figure, 20 replicates of this calculation were done for each $\Delta$ value to improve convergence statistics. 

\subsection{Example 3: Looping first-passage time}
Run a Brownian Dynamics simulation to track the first passage time to looping for 1000 chains in parallel. This example uses a chain where the 2 edge segments on either side have a segment length of $0.1$ and corresponding parameters, whereas all other segments have a segment length of $0.2$. The friction coefficients are supplied per unit length, which means the edge beads have half the friction of the 2-nd beads from the edge. Those in turn have half the friction of the inner beads (which correspond to longer segment lengths). The time to looping for each chain is output in the 3rd column of the file \path=ex.loop.loop.out= as each chain loops.

\subsection{Example 4: Looping first-passage time, with dynamic rediscretization}
Run a Brownian Dynamics simulation to track the first passage time to looping for 1000 chains in parallel. Rediscretize the whole chain dynamically by a factor of 4 (to segment lengths of 0.05) whenever the end-to-end distance goes below 0.4. Coarsen the chain whenever the end-to-end distance goes above 0.5. Parameters are interpolated from the file \path=dssWLCparams.txt=.

\subsection{Example 5: Monte Carlo}
Run a Monte Carlo simulation of $10^8$ steps for a dssWLC. Output the end-to-end distance every 1000 steps into columns 5-7 of the file \path=ex.montecarlo.out=.

\section{Auxiliary Scripts}

\subsection{Visualizing structures}

The script \path=scripts/snapshot2pdb.py= will convert a snapshot file containing many chain configurations into a concatenated pdb file that can be loaded into pymol. Run this script without any arguments to get usage information. 
To load the resulting snapshots into different states to make a movie do ``load snap.pdb, multiplex=0'' in pymol. Color an visualize in pymol using  \path=scripts/viewsnapshots.pml=.

\section{Parameters for the dssWLC model}
\label{sec:getparams}
The Matlab code for calculating the energetic and dynamic parameters for the dssWLC model is located in \path=getparams/=. The relevant function for getting the parameters is \path=dssWLCcalcparams=

There are three approaches to getting the parameters. Firstly, as described in Koslover and Spakowitz, Soft Matter, 2013, one can optimize of the parameter $\alpha = \eta^2\epsilon_b/\epsilon_\perp$ to get the minimal length scale of accuracy. This can be done for a chain with Nseg segments of length $\Delta = \text{del}$ by running the following in Matlab:

\begin{verbatim}
[eb,gam,epar,eperp,eta,alpha,zetau,delt] = dssWLCcalcparams(del,Nseg)
\end{verbatim}

These calculations can be very slow (taking on the order of 15 min). The first time this is run will be even slower as it needs to generate a tensor of coupling coefficients for spherical harmonics which will then by saved in a .mat file for future use. The size of the matrix used for calculating the structure factor is set with the optional parameter LMAX. Default value is LMAX=10. Smaller values of $\Delta$ require higher values of LMAX. Be aware, also, that optimization over $\alpha$ will sometimes settle in a local minimum that does not yield the optimum length scale of accuracy. This can be tweaked by hand by supplying a range of $\alpha$ values in which to search for the optimum.

The output parameters are, in order, $\epsilon_b, \gamma, \epsilon_\parallel, \epsilon_\perp, \eta, \alpha, \zeta_{ub}, \delta t$. They should be input into the parameter files for the Fortran simulation code as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{LP} & \quad & \epsilon_b \\
\text{GAM} & \quad & \gamma \\
\text{EPERP} & \quad & \epsilon_\perp + \eta^2\epsilon_b \\
\text{EPAR} & \quad & \epsilon_\parallel \\
\text{EC} & \quad & - \eta \epsilon_b \\
\text{FRICT} & \quad & L/(\text{Nseg}+1) \quad \zeta_{ub} \\
\text{DELTSCL} & \quad & \delta t/\zeta_{ub}
\end{eqnarray*}
(assuming that  $\zeta_{ub} < L/(\text{Nseg}+1)$). 

Alternately, one can input the friction coefficients per unit length, which needs to be done in the case where not all segment lengths are equal. If using this format, then even if all segment lengths are equal the edge beads will have have the translational friction of the central beads.
\begin{equation*}
\text{FRICT} \quad 1D0 \quad \zeta_{ub}(\text{Nseg}+1)/(\Delta \text{Nseg}) \quad T
\end{equation*}

Generally, if running a chain with different segment lengths, one should use the smallest segment length to determine the appropriate values of $\delta t$ and $\zeta_{ub}$. 

Another approach to selecting the parameters is to use a specific value of $\alpha$, which can be done as follows in Matlab for a value $\alpha=a$:
\begin{verbatim}
[eb,gam,epar,eperp,eta,alpha,zetau,delt] = dssWLCcalcparams(del,Nseg,`alpha',a)
\end{verbatim}
This will run much faster and is generally more stable. 

Finally, the recommended approach is to simply interpolate from the pretabulated values available in \path=getparams/dssWLCparams.txt=. This file lists on each line the values of $\Delta, \epsilon_b, \gamma, \epsilon_\parallel, \epsilon_\perp, \eta, \zeta_u, \delta t/\zeta_u$, respectively. The interpolation can be done via:
\begin{verbatim}
[eb,gam,epar,eperp,eta,alpha,zetau,delt] = dssWLCcalcparams(del,Nseg,`intepfile',`dssWLCparams.txt')
\end{verbatim}
The tabulated file was generated using optimization over $\alpha$ for $\Delta = 0.01 - 1$, and a constant value of $\alpha$ thereafter for $\Delta = 1 - 4$. The interpolation file was generated using \path=getparams/tabulateparams.m=
The matrix size used was $\text{LMAX}=12$ for $\Delta < 0.02$, $\text{LMAX}=10$ for $0.02<\Delta<0.04$, and $\text{LMAX}=9$ otherwise.  
%The matrix size used was $\text{LMAX}=14$ for $\Delta < 0.045$ and $\text{LMAX}=10$ otherwise. 

\section{Description of Specific Calculations}
\label{sec:tasks}

The {\em ACTION} keyword specifies what type of calculation will be
done. The possible actions are EQUILDISTRIB, BROWNDYN, and MONTECARLO, as described below.

\subsection{EQUILDISTRIB action}

This generates a bunch of dssWLC chain configurations sampled from an equilibrium distributions. The sampling method is set by the {\em STARTEQUIL} keyword (2 types of rejection sampling or monte carlo). Number of chains sampled is set by {\em MCSTEPS} keyword. Dumping of snapshots is set by the {\em SNAPSHOTS} keyword. End-to-end vectors for all configurations are output into the file set by {\em OUTFILE}. Will also work with a Gaussian chain (see {\em GAUSSIANCHAIN} keyword) and a bead-rod chain (if {\em STRETCHABLE} and {\em SHEARABLE} are set to false).

\subsection{BROWNDYN action}

This runs a Brownian Dynamics simulation for a set of chains, keeping track of the shear stress correlation over time. Use {\em NCHAIN} to set the number of chains being run in parallel, {\em BDSTEPS} to set the total number of steps and the printing / output frequency. Use {\em LOOPING} keyword to tabulate first passage times for looping of chain ends. {\em FRICT} keyword sets friction coefficients. {\em DELTSCL} keyword sets the timestep as a multiple of the friction coefficients. Can use {\em STARTEQUIL} keyword to start from an equilibrated set of configurations. Can periodically dump out snapshots of chain configurations.

\subsection{MONTECARLO action}

Run a Monte Carlo simulation for a dssWLC chain. Only Monte Carlo of a single chain at a time has been recently tested. Set total number of steps and number of initialization steps with the {\em MCSTEPS} keyword. Set printint / output frequency with {\em MCPRINTFREQ}. Can output snapshots with {\em SNAPSHOTS} keyword. Used {\em ADJUSTRANGE} keyword to set how often step sizes are adjusted. For the most part, this has been supplanted by the equilibrium configuration sampling (EQUILDISTRIB action). However this general procedure can be implemented with additional complications (ie: chain meshes, non-local interactions) which EQUILDISTRIB cannot.

\section{Keyword Index}
\label{sec:keywords}
The code will attempt to read parameters out of a file named \path=param.suffix= where ``suffix'' is the command line argument. If no command line arguments are supplied, it will look for a file named \path=param=. If multiple arguments are supplied, it will read multiple parameter files in sequence.

The parameter file should have one keyword per line and must end with a blank line. All blank lines and all lines beginning with \# are ignored. For the most part, the order of the lines and the capitalization of the keywords does not matter. All keywords except {\em ACTION} are optional. The default values for each parameter are listed below. If a keyword is supplied, then values may or may not be needed as well. Again, the required and optional value types are listed below. 

Keywords and multiple values are separated by spaces. 

When reading the parameter file, lines longer than 500 characters will be truncated. To continue onto the next line, add ``+++'' at the end of the line to be continued.
No individual keyword or  value should be longer than 100 characters.

Floating point numbers can be formated as $1.0$, $1.1D0$, $10e-1$, $-1.0E+01$, etc., where the exponential notation specifier must be D or E (case insensitive). Integer numbers can also be specified in exponential notation without decimal points (eg: 1000 or 1E3). Logical values can be specified as T, F, TRUE, FALSE, 1, or 0 (with 1 corresponding to true and 0 to false).

By default, all energy units are in kT.
